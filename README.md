# M4-Semester-Project


This repository contains 2 python notebooks: the Master Notebook which contains all the code except the script for collecting data in the form of tweets. The latter can be found in the notebook titeld "scraping tweets"

The data used in this project is also uploaded here: the historical price of Ethereum, the google trends searches of three keywords, and the labeled tweets used for the sentiment analysis. 

The file with the data on NFTs is too large for uploading on GitHub (3.7GB, whereas the uploading limit on github is 25MB according to GitHub), and as such it is linked here: https://osf.io/vejrt/?view_only=319a53cf1bf542bbbe538aba37916537, the file named "Data_API.csv.gz". The link was last accessed 10/01/2022.
