# M4-Semester-Project


This repository contains 2 python notebooks: the Master Notebook which contains all the code except the script for collecting data in the form of tweets. The latter can be found in the notebook titeld "scraping tweets"

Some of the data used in this project is also uploaded in the repository: the historical price of Ethereum and the google trends searches of three keywords

The file with the data on NFTs is too large for uploading on GitHub (3.7GB, whereas the uploading limit on github is 25MB according to GitHub), and as such it is linked here: https://osf.io/vejrt/?view_only=319a53cf1bf542bbbe538aba37916537, the file named "Data_API.csv.gz". The link was last accessed 10/01/2022. 

This google drive folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YECHi03csmR1jcGNLHCrMHlFyINWvvDl contains other data used throughout the notebook (the files have been renamed in this folder so that they are easier to identify).
